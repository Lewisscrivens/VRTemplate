# VRTemplate

Overview:

A Virtual Reality template created using Unreal Engine and running currently for version UE4.23, the project includes a demo level showing examples of how 
each component/actor can be used aswell as comments across all of my classes where I have tried to best describe why I have wrote the code in the way I have 
aswell as what functions do in the h files. The base of everything works through the VRHand class and the hand interface which allows very modular code aswell 
as making it easy to add new components ontop of whats already here.

Features:

- Working VRPawn and VRHand classes for grabbing objects.
- Comprehensive movement class that supports six movement modes.
- Developer mode that allows testing using keyboard, mouse and monitor without a VR headset.
- Grabbable objects.
- Rotatable objects.
- Slidable objects.
- Working whiteboard, marker and rubber.
- Weapon and target examples.
- Modular Dials, switches and buttons that can be added to other interactables.
- A demo level showing all of the features mentioned above.
