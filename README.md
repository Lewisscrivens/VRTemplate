# VRTemplate 1.0

Overview:

A Virtual Reality template created using Unreal Engine and running currently for version UE4.23, the project includes a demo level showing examples of how 
each component/actor can be used as well as comments across all of my classes where I have tried to best describe why I have wrote the code in the way I have. 
Also in the h files I have commented over each funtion what they do. The base of everything works through the VRHand class and the hand interface which allows 
modular use of the classes I have created.

Features:

- Working VRPawn and VRHand classes for grabbing objects.
- A comprehensive movement class that supports six movement modes.
- Developer mode that allows testing using keyboard, mouse and monitor without a VR headset.
- Grabbable objects.
- Rotatable objects.
- Slidable objects.
- Working white board, marker and rubber.
- Weapon and target examples.
- Modular Dials, switches and buttons that can be added to other intractable.
- A demo level showing all of the features mentioned above.
